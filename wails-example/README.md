# README

Some toy application to do some fun k8s stuff.

## About

This is the official Wails React-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about
the project settings can be found here:
https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This
will run a Vite development server that will provide very fast hot reload of
your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser and have access to
your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on
http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your browser, and you can call your
Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.

## QA.
