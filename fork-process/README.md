# About

This tutorial covers Linux process programming. You can read chapter 3 of
[Advanced Linux Programming](https://mentorembedded.github.io/advancedlinuxprogramming/alp-folder/advanced-linux-programming.pdf)
for some basic knowledge.

## Python example

`fork-example.py` is written following gunicorn
[arbiter.py](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/76f8da24cbb992d168e01bda811452bcf3b8f5b3/gunicorn/arbiter.py#L17-L18).

Note, it cannot run in Ipython. See
[issue-2426](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/2426/).
